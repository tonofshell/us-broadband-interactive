            <h4 class="cp-explanation">As the Internet has developed in America, so has a so called "digital
                divide". Americans of contrasting socioeconomic backgrounds have greatly differing
                abilities to use and access innovative technologies. This digital divide not only exacerbates
                inequality across the country, it feeds into itself as well. Many tech companies continue to develop
                products that cater more to the upper class and their own profit margins, than those that may benefit
                from technological advances the most. As Internet access has become essential part of many Americans'
                everyday lives, elsewhere in the country, large swaths of America are increasingly being left
                behind.</h4>
